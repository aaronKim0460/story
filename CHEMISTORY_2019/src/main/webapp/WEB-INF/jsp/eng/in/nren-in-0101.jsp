		<p>Health and environmental effects of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) have become a matter of great public concern these days. As a result, the public demand for safer and more pleasant environment is greater than ever. Accordingly, we will further strengthen practical, on-site research efforts to help address environmental issues so that the public feel the real benefits in their lives.
