		<p class="history-txt">As a result of rapid industrialization and urbanization in the 1970s, environmental pollution emerged as a serious social problem in Korea.<br />
		In response to the various environmental challenges of the time, the National Environmental Protection Institute (NEPI) was established by the Korean government in July 1978.<br />
		In 2005, NEPI was expanded and renamed as the National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER) with more researchers, research infrastructure and equipment. NIER has been consolidating its position as a leading government-run research institute dedicated to environmental studies by streamlining its organization and reinforcing its research capacity.<br />
		NIER remain committed to better fulfilling its role as a government-run environmental research institute whose work is vital to the development and implementation of Koreaâ€™s environmental policies and pollution prevention programs.</p>
